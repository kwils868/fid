    <div class="grid">
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Texas Powderpuff &#x2640</h3>
        <p>The leader of the Bandits. Middle name is Briar, hence the groups label. A Tiefling girl with big dreams of being something greater, and a skilled skateboarder! Also a high school nerd with... admittedly, not many other friends, really.</p>

        <h3>Amara Snort &#x1f41a;</h3>
        <p>Texas' best friend, a one-year-younger fish gal. A surfer, who's emotionally intelligent... Also a bit clumsy. The lack of deep sea pressure in her above-water life makes her limbs a bit droopy.</p>

      <div class="card">
        <h3>Merth Gray &#x2642</h3>
        <p>An older teen goblin boy, with a bit of an attitude. Always getting into trouble, without ever intending it. A quick-witted contrast to his sister, Moralie, with a never-ending fire that burns bright inside his chest. Never goes anywhere without his Toadgoat, who he affectionately named Tonker.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Moralie Gray &#x2640</h3>
        <p>The youngest of the group, and Merths' sister. A chronically overworked 13 year-old, with a fascination for the unexplained. Experiencing a 1/9th life crisis, and a little (very) anxious about this new adventure.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Bene &#x2640</h3>
        <p>A strange-looking elf that was simply dragged along on the ride, not originally a part of the group... But she is now! Staff worker at the Bandits' meeting spot back on Earth 02, Palm Tree Skatepark. Tripped into this mess, but it might be for the better, as she comes to find out.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card">
        <h3>Olivie (?)</h3>
        <p>A bird-person with a great appreciation for the non-living. Finding the beauty in all around them, Olivie is a pacifist, who wants to delve deeper into their family's rich history and culture. They always had a twinge of interest towards what happens after life is lived. </p>

    <h2>About the Show</h2>
    <p>Created by Kaia Williams, Railgrind is a western cartoon focused around a lighthearted bunch of characters thrown into something more real than would be expected. Covering important and semi-difficult themes, this PG-13 aimed show focuses on using non-human characters and settings to portray very human experiences. Comedy, drama, action and sci-fi/fantasy galore! A mix of everything, for everyone to love and enjoy.</p>

<p>Though, Railgrind didn't get here without a lot of changes to the original story, formerly Texas Powderpuff. An entirely different plot! You can check out some early concept art of Texas here! <nav><a href="texasconcepts.html">Pre-Railgrind Concepts</a></nav></p>
